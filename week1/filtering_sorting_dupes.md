On Windows, over on the right side of Home. (Select all your columns first.)

Mac - the DATA tab.

**You should be sure you select ALL the Columns before you pick the Filter icon.**

1. Click this triangle, it will highlight all of them.
2. THEN select the filter icon (it will be on Data tab or Home).
3. You should see the little sorting arrows on each column if you did it right.

###### Exercises
Import the CSV version of ChiCrimes data (Chicago crime data), if you haven't yet.

Open ChiCrimes data and try filters:

*A nice feature in recent Excels – saves you time and helps you troubleshoot your data:*

*On Mac, you can pick one to show - sum is default, I think. Change to count.*

### Filters can be combined with sorting to get answers to questions.
1. Filter to show only Primary Type Burglary.
2. Then sort by Date, Ascending.
This puts the earliest date/time for the burglaries first, and the latest last.

*What is the last burglary in this data?*

###### Exercises in Class:

 So, using filters, tell me... ln the Chicago crimes:  
  * What dates does this data cover?
  * How many offenses occurred at Animal Hospitals?
  * Did they occur at the same one?
  * What about at Airports? Did they occur at the same one?
  * Find all offenses that occurred anywhere on Whipple Street:   
  (Hint : Use a search or text filter.)
    * How many where there?
    * How many Whipple locations are there?
  * Look at just Sexual Offenses. Can you see anything interesting here?

*Warning: Don’t forget you might have filters in action and not see your whole data set. To turn off all the filters, just hit the filter button again:*

### Useful for counting: Remove Duplicates

A useful trick - removing duplicates to see what your unique field values are.
