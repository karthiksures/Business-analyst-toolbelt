### Text and Data Formulae to Clean

Trim removes whitespace!
Proper makes title case.  Example in this video of cleaning a column to fix the case to "proper." (In French, "nompropre".)

### Reminder about Formulae Cell References

Remember:
  * A2 : relative reference : both may change when you copy the formula.
  * A$2 : fixed row, relative column -- will change when you copy column.
  * $A2 : fixed column, relative row -- will change when you copy row.
  * $A$2 : fixed column and cell, will not change when you copy formula.

### Use a Formula to Extract Text

Let’s try to split up the data on the street address for Chicago crimes.  
Copy the block column onto a new sheet. Enter this formula (but the french version, probably "trouve(‘ ‘;A2)"... in b2:

Then you can use another formula to get the right end of the string,

* RIGHT(text, number_of_chars) [French: DROITE]
* LEN(text)  [French: NBCAR]

How would you combine them?  In one formula. Work with me!

One answer:  **=RIGHT(A2, LEN(A2)-6)**; or in French **=DROITE(A2; NBCAR(A2)-6)**

Why does this work?

### After Formula Use: Paste As Values  

After you finish your formula and get your results, it’s very important to copy the data and paste it as values — because leaving a formula in a cell can cause bad problems.

### Problem with Formulas

Why is it bad to leave formulas in the workbook in your cleaned data?

  * They are not obvious to a reader of the sheet - you have to put your mouse in a cell to see them
  * If you move a column or cell, you can destroy the formula without noticing it. (The references will break)
  * It is easy to “mess up” your formula with an accidental click in a cell containing one, and then you have lost important data

After doing this operation...

You should have both columns - the original, and the new derived column (pasted as values, no formula in the cell!)
