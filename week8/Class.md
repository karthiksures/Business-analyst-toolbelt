# Exercises

1. What does Hans Rosling say if you were to make it as static charts in a story without him animating it?  Sketch the main screens you would include.

2. In groups of 3, use the contents of the Tableau Workbook SuperStore_InClass to make a story.  If you feel a graph or two is missing, you can add those or put a placeholder with a note in saying "We would make a chart showing:".

You can do it on paper (if I can follow it well and it has enough detail) or in the Workbook which you will then turn in (packaged!).  Make sure all the group members are named in the submission.  It is due today.
