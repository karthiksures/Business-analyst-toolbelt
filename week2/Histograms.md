# Histograms

Histograms show you the "distribution" of your numeric data.

How many values are between 0 and 10?  11 and 20?  etc.

## Making Histograms with Pivot Tables

Video Demo: [Making a Histogram with Pivot Tables](https://youtu.be/0zQ-xQ8_Yro)

Open the **Unpivoted** (i.e., "tidy") Paris Rainfall file. It should have columns for Year, Month, Value.  Make a pivot table using Value and Count of Value:

Make a copy of the result and paste into a new sheet.  Make a bar chart.

This is a histogram!  It tells us that the range with the most values in our data is 40-49 inches of rain!  There are over 500 values in this range.

**For your homework, you will make a histogram of the rainfall of the month of May only.  Save it on a new tab called "histogram."**

Histograms are the numeric version of counting categoric (text) values.
