## Homework for week 7


* You will turn in a pdf of Word or PPT with your Tableau charts (export them as images and paste into your doc, then save your doc as PDF to upload it to Brightspace).  Do not turn in your workbook.  You can create 2 pdf files if you want (for the 2 parts).

* Your charts should have good titles, captions if needed, labels where you can fit them, especially labels on outliers where appropriate, appropriate sort order (max to min), and clear units so I know what you did (sum, average, what?).

* To do these queries, you will have to create a new connection for each SQL query that is different.

## Part 1: Using the Mondial Database

* Chart the top 10 tallest mountains (not mountain ranges). Add data labels on them.
* Make a map showing population per area of each country. Use dots for this one. Label the big ones! (Make a calculated field for this.)
* Map countries by population. Use a choropleth map (shaded). Label the darkest ones!
* Make a map showing GDP of each country in Europe. Use a filter to limit to Europe (or another method).
* Chart the top 10 country capitals by their population (the city pop, not the country pop). (This does not have to be a map.)

## Part 2: Using Jobs Database

* Chart the enterprises with the most job postings (top 10, descending)
* Show job counts by type of contract in the database.
* Graph the job titles with the highest number of views per day they have been active on the site (the Date field is a valid SQL date). You might need to figure out days by subtracting from the most recent date in the database. (You can calculate in SQL, or a calculate field in Tableau.)
* Add another query/chart that interests you. Be sure to title it, label it well, and label outliers.
