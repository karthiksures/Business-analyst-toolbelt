## Tableau Database Drivers - Install Before Next Week

Connecting to MySQL in Tableau [help doc](http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/help.htm#examples_mysql.html).

You must install the database drivers for Tableau before next week.  The downloads link is here: https://www.tableau.com/support/drivers

Pick the one for MySQL and your laptop OS.  Follow directions.  (On Mac this means installing 2 things, the iodbc thing and the driver for MySQL afterwards. Follow instructions.)
