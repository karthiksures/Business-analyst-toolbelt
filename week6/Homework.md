# Homework Tableau


### Required for the Homework

http://www.tableau.com/fr-fr/learn/training

Use this data: http://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/getting-started_data-sets_fr-fr.zip

Watch “Demarrage” and “L’Interface de Tableau.”  
For HW, you will recreate the charts in the “Demarrage” video.

You owe two files:

Do the main examples in the Intro video (“Demarrage") and upload a PDF of your workbook. (Points for completeness!) See end of my [Tableau Intro](Tableau.md)  for how to export PDFs. (Yes, it will look bad as an export. I’m looking for evidence you did the examples.)

In a new Tableau workbook, connect to an excel or CSV sheet we have used in class and make 4 new charts that show interesting things. Points for finding things that are interesting to show! Make sure they have descriptive titles. Save them individually into a PPT or Word document (again see end of [Tableau.md](Tableau.md)), and convert it to PDF.  Upload that too.
